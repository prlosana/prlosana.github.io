I started this post saying that I've always been interested in learn but I've never thought about how we learn, I mean the process of learn itself. As my research is focused on mixed reality in education and immersive learning I think this is something I should need to know so here we go...

*What is learning?*
*Learning* is commonly defined as a process that brings together cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences and experiences for acquiring, enhancing, or making changes in one's knowledge, skills, values, and world views (*Illeris, 2004; Ormrod, 1995*).

"Learning is a persisting change in human performance or performance potential…[which] must come about as a result of the learner’s experience and interaction with the world" (*Driscoll, 2000*)
It is also thought of as the way in which information is absorbed, processed, and retained. -This concept sounds more similar to computer processing!-

*How we learn?*

"*Learning Theories*" are elaborate hypotheses that describe how exactly this procedure occurs.

There are three main categories or philosophical frameworks under which learning theories fall:

	- *Behaviourism*. Learning is the acquisition of new behavior through conditioning.  Learning is manifested by a change in behaviour. The environment shapes behaviour. The principles of contiguity (how close in time two events must be for a bond to be formed) and reinforcement (any means of increasing the likelihood that an event will be repeated) are central to explaining the learning process.  The main exponents: *John Watson & B. F. Skinner*.

	- *Cognitivism* look beyond behavior to explain brain-based learning. The memory system is an active organized processor of information. Prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Cognitivists consider how human memory works to promote learning. Aspects of cognitivism can be found in learning how to learn, social role acquisition, intelligence, learning, and memory as related to age. Cognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology. The individual learner is more key to gestaltists than the environment that behaviorists emphasize.  The main exponents:  *A.D. Baddeley,  Atkinson & Shiffrin.*

	- *Constructivism* views learning as a process in which the learner actively constructs or builds new ideas or concepts. Emphasizes the importance of active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves.  Learning is a very personal endeavor, whereby internalized concepts, rules, and general principles may consequently be applied in a practical real-world context. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working to solve realistic problems. The main exponents:  *Piaget, Bruner, John Dewey, Marie Montessori, David Kolb.*

Recently new theories on learning have raised as a result on technology and science advances:*
*

	- ***Transformative Learning***  is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference although it is recognized that important emotional changes are often involved. Our frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view. Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are more fixed and influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, whereas points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning leads to autonomous and responsible thinking which is essential for full citizenship in democracy and for moral decision making in situations of rapid change. (*Mezirow, 1997*).

	- ***Neuroeducation*** an emerging new learning theory  founded on connecting what we know about how the brain processes and stores information with classroom instruction and experiences.Neuroeducation analyzed the biological change in the brain as new information is processed and looks at what environmental, emotional, social situations are best in order for the new information to be processed. (*Wolf, 2010*).

	- **Connectivism** was introduced as a theory of learning based on the premise that knowledge exists in the world rather than in the head of an individual.  Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements – not entirely under the control of the individual. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical. Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning.  (*Siemens, 2005*). KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

Well, after a brief review of the ways how we learn here is a video explaining better Connectivism:
