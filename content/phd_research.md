My PhD entitled **"Exploring Mixed Reality in Distributed Collaborative Learning Environments"** (2016) focused on possible interactions within a mixed reality distributed environment, with the aim to provide a platform to enable numerous real and virtual intelligent environments (across the world) to be connected together; changing perception of environments/spaces from one-dimensional (physical) to multi-dimensional (physical and virtual); and extending human capabilities into a computer-generated spaces able to reflect information in real time.

My PhD research was part of the **Scale Up project**, a research collaboration between the University of Essex (UK) and King Abdul-Aziz University (KSA) which aimed to scale-up existing technology in intelligent inhabited environments from smaller facilities to a complete campus with multi-story large footprint buildings; towards the goal of developing large scale real-world Intelligent Environments.

Within the Scale up project, this research was related to mixed-reality lifestyles and human-computer interaction (HCI), and investigated how to use mixed-reality (MR) and immersive technologies to create large-scale collaborative environments. The research investigated the following main issues:

1. **The creation of a computational model** for sharing a mix of real/virtual objects within a scaled-up interconnection of immersive environments.

2. **The definition of a distributed model** (both technical and pedagogical) of physical and virtual objects to support methodologies for collaboration in mixed reality distributed environments; scaling up dual reality from single users to multiple users in collaborative activities.

## Research Outcomes

As part of the research, I [published](/publications/):
- **1 patent**
- **9 conference publications** (lead author)
- **Best Technical Video** [award](/leadership/) at the 2014 IEEE Intelligent Environments conference

## International Evaluation

The thesis reported on evaluations performed with students from eight different universities in six countries:
- China
- Malaysia
- Mexico
- UAE
- USA
- UK

This provided an important insight to the role of social interactions in distance learning, and demonstrated that the inclusion of a physical component made a positive difference to students' learning experience, supporting the use of mixed reality objects in educational activities.

## Thesis Details

This thesis submitted for the degree of **Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science** by the University of Essex, was defended on **15th January, 2016**. I was co-supervised by **Prof. Vic Callaghan** and **Dr. Michael Gardner**.
