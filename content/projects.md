- KTP Associate within the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project between British Telecommunications PLC and the University of Essex to develop remote workforce management solutions and embed knowledge of advanced computational intelligence, intelligent environments and augmented reality. [KTP9985](http://info.ktponline.org.uk/action/details/partnership.aspx?id=9985).

- Doctoral researcher within the "Scale up Intelligent Environments" project, a 5-year joint project between the University of Essex, UK and King Abdulaziz University, KSA. Its purpose was to investigate the Scaling-Up of Intelligent Environments from the current small scale, beyond four walls to the large-scale.

My PhD entitled *"Exploring Mixed Reality in Distributed Collaborative Learning Environments"* (2016) focused on possible interactions within a mixed reality distributed environment, with the aim to provide a platform to enable numerous real and virtual intelligent environments (across the world) to be connected together; changing perception of environments/spaces from one-dimensional (physical) to multi-dimensional (physical and virtual); and extending human capabilities into a computer-generated spaces able to reflect information in real time.

FortiTo's BuzzBoards™ educational technology system is based on a series of pluggable hardware and software modules, which can be assembled in different combinations, determining both the functionality and physical form, to create a variety of electronic prototypes.

These drivers (developed in **Phyton**) use the **I2C protocol** to add sensors and actuators to a **Raspberry Pi** through a hub base board (BuzzBerry).
