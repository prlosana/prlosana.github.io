The Tommy Flowers Institute was launched on September 29, 2016 by British Telecom and partners to develop the ICT research leaders of the future. Based at Adastral Park near Ipswich, the Institute will support doctoral and post-doctoral researchers by exposing them to strategic industry challenges through a programme of conferences, targeted networking events and tailored support.

The aim is for the Institute to be the major national centre for supporting the development of future leaders in ICT research by 2020. It will do this by bringing researchers together to collaborate across multiple academic disciplines – and by encouraging a seamless link between academia and industry.
