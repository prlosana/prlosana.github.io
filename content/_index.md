# About

Computer Scientist with extensive industry and technical expertise in technology, security, data, and strategy. I have 20+ years of diverse experience managing complex multidisciplinary projects and leading international teams in industry and academia. I deliver new solutions to business challenges, highlighting opportunities in areas that support strategic priorities and impact future business.

I am a Distinguished Engineer and Research Manager at BT Research Labs (UK) and a Senior Member of the IEEE (SMIEEE). I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an MSc in Advanced Web Engineering from the University of Essex (UK), where I am an [Honorary Senior Lecturer](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/penar50207/anasol-pena-rios). Before that, I completed a BEng in Information Technology at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Mexico).

I have produced multiple patents and peer-reviewed publications. In 2020, I received the TechWomen100 Award and was shortlisted for the Computing Women in Tech Excellence Awards in 2018 and 2023. My areas of expertise include digital twins, XR (mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality), artificial intelligence, internet-of-things, ambient intelligence, human-computer interfaces, and cyber-physical systems. I am also interested in remote collaborative work, technology-enhanced learning, innovation, and the idea-generation process. I volunteer and organise conferences, workshops, and journals on these topics.

I sit on the Executive Board of two non-profits: [Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)](https://immersivelrn.org/) and the [Technical Committee on Immersive Learning Environments](https://ieee-edusociety.org/technical-committee/tc-ile) (IEEE Education Society), where I contribute to leading their strategic goals into actionable recommendations. I am also part of the [Advisory Group of the DT Hub](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/about/advisory-group/) initiative (UK), a knowledge-sharing community supported by the Catapult Network (InnovateUK/UKRI) and working in collaboration with the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and I am and advisor at the [Creative Science Foundation (CSf)](https://creative-science.org/).
