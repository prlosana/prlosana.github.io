[{"content":" Mixed Reality Research Environment My PhD entitled \u0026ldquo;Exploring Mixed Reality in Distributed Collaborative Learning Environments\u0026rdquo; (2016) focused on possible interactions within a mixed reality distributed environment, with the aim to provide a platform to enable numerous real and virtual intelligent environments (across the world) to be connected together; changing perception of environments/spaces from one-dimensional (physical) to multi-dimensional (physical and virtual); and extending human capabilities into a computer-generated spaces able to reflect information in real time.\nMy PhD research was part of the Scale Up project, a research collaboration between the University of Essex (UK) and King Abdul-Aziz University (KSA) which aimed to scale-up existing technology in intelligent inhabited environments from smaller facilities to a complete campus with multi-story large footprint buildings; towards the goal of developing large scale real-world Intelligent Environments.\nWithin the Scale up project, this research was related to mixed-reality lifestyles and human-computer interaction (HCI), and investigated how to use mixed-reality (MR) and immersive technologies to create large-scale collaborative environments. The research investigated the following main issues:\nThe creation of a computational model for sharing a mix of real/virtual objects within a scaled-up interconnection of immersive environments.\nThe definition of a distributed model (both technical and pedagogical) of physical and virtual objects to support methodologies for collaboration in mixed reality distributed environments; scaling up dual reality from single users to multiple users in collaborative activities.\nMixed Reality Research Environment Research Outcomes As part of the research, I published:\n1 patent 9 conference publications (lead author) Best Technical Video award at the 2014 IEEE Intelligent Environments conference International Evaluation The thesis reported on evaluations performed with students from eight different universities in six countries:\nChina Malaysia Mexico UAE USA UK This provided an important insight to the role of social interactions in distance learning, and demonstrated that the inclusion of a physical component made a positive difference to students\u0026rsquo; learning experience, supporting the use of mixed reality objects in educational activities.\nThesis Details This thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science by the University of Essex, was defended on 15th January, 2016. I was co-supervised by Prof. Vic Callaghan and Dr. Michael Gardner.\nRecognition My PhD Thesis abstract was selected for publication at the IEEE Intelligent Informatics Bulletin (August 2017 issue) This research was also mentioned by the media in various publications: Blending Realities to Create a Truly Global Workforce, University of Essex, 14 April 2015 Blending Realities to Create a Truly Global Workforce, Phys.org, 16 April 2015 Callaghan, V., (2015).

As my research is focused on mixed reality in education and immersive learning I think this is something I should need to know so here we go\u0026hellip;\nWhat is learning? Learning¬†is commonly defined as a process that brings together cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences and experiences for acquiring, enhancing, or making changes in one\u0026rsquo;s knowledge, skills, values, and world views (Illeris, 2004; Ormrod, 1995).\n\u0026ldquo;Learning is a persisting change in human performance or performance potential‚Ä¶[which] must come about as a result of the learner‚Äôs experience and interaction with the world\u0026rdquo; (Driscoll, 2000) It is also thought of as the way in which information is absorbed, processed, and retained. -This concept sounds more similar to computer processing!-\nHow we learn?\n\u0026ldquo;Learning Theories\u0026rdquo; are elaborate hypotheses that describe how exactly this procedure occurs.\nThere are three main categories or philosophical frameworks under which learning theories fall:\n- *Behaviourism*.¬†Learning is the acquisition of new behavior through conditioning.¬†Learning is manifested by a change in behaviour. The environment shapes behaviour. The principles of contiguity (how close in time two events must be for a bond to be formed) and reinforcement (any means of increasing the likelihood that an event will be repeated) are central to explaining the learning process. The main exponents:¬†*John Watson \u0026amp; B. F. Skinner*. - *Cognitivism* look beyond behavior to explain brain-based learning.¬†The memory system is an active organized processor of information. Prior knowledge plays an important role in learning.¬†Cognitivists consider how human memory works to promote learning.¬†Aspects of cognitivism can be found in learning how to learn, social role acquisition, intelligence, learning, and memory as related to age. Cognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology.¬†The individual learner is more key to gestaltists than the environment that behaviorists emphasize.¬†The main exponents: *A.D. Baddeley, Atkinson \u0026amp; Shiffrin.* - *Constructivism* views learning as a process in which the learner actively constructs or builds new ideas or concepts. Emphasizes the importance of active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves.¬†Learning is a very personal endeavor, whereby internalized concepts, rules, and general principles may consequently be applied in a practical real-world context.¬†The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working to solve realistic problems.¬†The main exponents: *Piaget, Bruner,¬†John Dewey, Marie Montessori, David Kolb.* Recently new theories on learning have raised as a result on technology and science advances:* *\n- ***Transformative Learning***¬†is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference¬†although it is recognized that important emotional changes are often involved.¬†Our frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view.¬†Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are more fixed and influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, whereas points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning leads to autonomous and responsible thinking which is essential for full citizenship in democracy and for moral decision making in situations of rapid change. (*Mezirow, 1997*). - ***Neuroeducation***¬†an emerging new learning theory¬†founded on connecting what we know about how the brain processes and stores information with classroom instruction and experiences.Neuroeducation analyzed the biological change in the brain as new information is processed and looks at what environmental, emotional, social situations are best in order for the new information to be processed.¬†(*Wolf, 2010*). - **Connectivism**¬†was introduced as a theory of learning based on the premise that knowledge exists in the world rather than in the head of an individual.¬†Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements ‚Äì not entirely under the control of the individual. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical.¬†Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning.¬†(*Siemens, 2005*).
